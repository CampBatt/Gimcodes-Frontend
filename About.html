The old syntax was /change:MessageNumber:NewMessage where the message number was the number of the message going from top too bottom, it is now reversed and goes from bottom to top. For example if  you were to change the most recently sent message you would type /change:1:test.</li>
                <li>/delete command now works differntly. Used to delete the last sent message but now can delete any message using /delete:MessageNumber, works simmarly to /change.</li>
                <li>/clear command removed, made obselete by the updated /delete command.</li>
                <li>/fill command removed, was next to useless.</li>

                <li>Fixed the latest code not automaticly refreshing.</li>
                <li>Removed the pop-up to check if you are afk as it doesn't do anything in google chrome.</li>
                <li>Removed the footer that said "Gimcodes website made by Aiden Towne", was useless and just caused issues.</li>
                <br>
                <b>Roadmap</b>
                <li>I came up with a basic roadmap for the Gimcodes.</li>
